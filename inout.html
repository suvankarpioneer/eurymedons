            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>This world is suffering from hunger and a lot of other stuff. 
                Yet, here we are, coding, trying to make the world a better place to live. This, so called 'civilisation' created
                by human beings, is just a savagery with discipline. The day the earth was green was the day when every animal on earth
                 livead happily. And suddenly one day, aliens land on earth living behind this species called 
                 human beings with its big brain. 
                And the human beings started their reign on this planet, destroying everything,piece by piece.
